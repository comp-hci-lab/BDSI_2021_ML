    "\n",
    "This dataset contains data for a total of **12,000 patient admissions**. For the tutorials, we will use data from the **first 2,500 patients** to explore several modeling and hyperparameter selection techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each admission is associated with a RecordID (filename), and a separate csv file under data/files/. These csv files contain timestamped observations for several variables. Outcomes for each patient admission are listed in data/labels.csv, in which the first column is RecordID. The second column In-hospital mortality contains binary labels: 1 means the patient died in the hospital, and −1 means the patient survived and was discharged. The third column 30-day survival also contains binary labels: 1 means the patient died within 30 days, and −1 means the patient survived past 30 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each patient admission, you are given data representing the first 48 hours of the ICU admission, as a csv file with three columns: `Time`, `Variable` and `Value`. Each row in the csv file represents a single observation. Each observation has an associated timestamp indicating the time of the observation relative to the start of the ICU admission, in hours and minutes. For example, a timestamp of 35:19 means that the associated observation was made 35 hours and 19 minutes after the patient was admitted to the ICU.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of variables: time-invariant and time-varying. Their definitions are specified in `config.yaml`. In particular, time-invariant variables are collected at the time the patient is admitted to the ICU. Their associated timestamps are set to 00:00 (thus they appear at the beginning of each patient’s record). Unknown values are explicitly encoded as −1. On the other hand, time-series variables (e.g., heart rate) for a patient might be measured one time, many times or not at all. You will notice that, in addition to being time-invariant or time-varying, a variable could be one of the heterogeneous data types: numeric or categorical. See the documentation for more details regarding the meaning of each variable.\n",
